  question-1:
    title: "What is the MRI scanner comprised of?"
    answer: "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, commonly called MRI, is a non-invasive, painless procedure that produces very detailed pictures of soft body tissue and organs without using ionizing radiation, as with other diagnostic procedures such as X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT). Using a large magnet, radio waves and complex computer and software technology, MRI scans the patient's body and produces two or three-dimensional images of body tissues. MRI is important as both a screening and diagnostic tool due to its ability to detect many cardiovascular, neurological, oncological and musculoskeletal diseases/injuries earlier and more accurately than other modalities."
